1. General Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from the community! To maintain the project's integrity and quality, please follow the guidelines below:
Respectful communication: Always be polite and constructive in your communication.
Keep the code clean: Follow the project‚Äôs code style and structure. Ensure your code is readable and well-documented.
Test before committing: Ensure any changes you make are fully tested and do not break existing functionality.
Submit detailed pull requests: When submitting pull requests (PRs), include a clear description of what the change does and why it‚Äôs necessary.

2. Commit Guidelines
Commit Messages: Use concise and descriptive commit messages that summarize the changes made.
Good: fix: resolved issue with video buffering in Chrome
Bad: fixing stuff
Commit Frequency: Make frequent, small commits with atomic changes. This makes code review and debugging easier.
Signed Commits: If possible, sign your commits to verify authenticity.

3. Pull Request Guidelines
Create a branch: For every feature or bug fix, create a new branch. Follow the naming convention: feature/feature-name or fix/issue-name.
Sync with main: Before making a pull request, always sync your branch with the latest version of main.
```bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
Describe your PR: In the pull request description, explain why the changes are needed, what was done, and how to test it.
```

4. Push Guidelines
Push to a branch, not main: Never push directly to the main branch. Always create a separate branch and push your changes to that branch.
```bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/feature-name
Keep it clean: Before pushing, ensure there are no unnecessary files in the commit (e.g., .env, node_modules, etc.).
```

5. Review and Approval
Pull Request Review: All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other contributor before merging.
Approval Process: After approval, only maintainers or authorized contributors can merge the pull request into the main branch.
